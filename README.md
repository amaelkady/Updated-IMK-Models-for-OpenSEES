# Updated-IMK-Models-for-OpenSEES
Updates for the modified Ibarra-Medina-Krawinkler deterioration models (Bilinear, Peak-Oriented, Pinching). These models supersede those in OpenSEES where convergence problems and issues with deterioration rules are fixed.

*** UPDATE August 2020 ***

--> Use the provided OpenSEES executable (OpenSEES.exe) directly. This compiled executable contains the most updated IMK models.
--> You will also need to download the "tcl86t.dll" file and place it in the same directory as the executable.
